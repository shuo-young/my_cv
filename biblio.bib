  abstract  = {Recently, the birth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has attracted great attention. NFTs are capable of representing users’ ownership on the blockchain and have experienced tremendous market sales due to their popularity. Unfortunately, the high value of NFTs also makes them a target for attackers. The defects in NFT smart contracts could be exploited by attackers to harm the security and reliability of the NFT ecosystem. Despite the significance of this issue, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing NFT smart contracts, which may raise worries about the security of users’ NFTs. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce 5 defects in NFT smart contracts. Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example highlighting its features and consequences, paired with possible solutions to fix it. Furthermore, we propose a tool named NFTGuard to detect our defined defects based on a symbolic execution framework. Specifically, NFTGuard extracts the information of the state variables from the contract abstract syntax tree (AST), which is critical for identifying variable-loading and storing operations during symbolic execution. Furthermore, NFTGuard recovers source-code-level features from the bytecode to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. We run NFTGuard on 16,527 real-world smart contracts and perform an evaluation based on the manually labeled results. We find that 1,331 contracts contain at least one of the 5 defects, and the overall precision achieved by our tool is 92.6\%.},

  abstract  = {With the proliferation of various types of blockchain applications, smart contracts are getting more and more essential in developing decentralized applications due to their powerful expressing capabilities. However, security vulnerabilities of smart contracts keep arising in recent years, which has attracted a lot of attention. Most of the related research mainly focuses on smart contracts deployed on Ethereum. But in the meantime, more and more types of smart contracts adopt Wasm as their bytecode format due to its smaller size and higher operating efficiency in blockchain. To avoid the recurrence of exploited vulnerabilities in Wasm smart contracts, we develop WaLi, a control-flow-based analyzer for security vulnerabilities. In particular, we first construct a control flow graph based on the Wasm bytecode and define a critical path identification method to locate possible paths that may contain vulnerabilities. Then we adopt a Wasm virtual machine to simulate a runtime environment when tracing the critical paths and report the result based on our vulnerability detection patterns. We choose Liquid smart contracts on FISCO-BCOS to illustrate our approach and the experimental results show that WaLi performs well in detecting the access control vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions of dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability detection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts with reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of detected reentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools less effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice. In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker contracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts automatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively detects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant call flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of reentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or user-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rule-based tools. We implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques based on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker contracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889 Ethereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target 159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at approximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim contracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.},
